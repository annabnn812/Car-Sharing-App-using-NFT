            <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            My idea is to build a car sharing application using Decentralized ID (DiD) 
            and temporary NFTs assigned to drivers when they book a vehicle. 
            Imagine a situation where you were on a flight for several hours to a foreign country,
             and upon arrival you need to rent a car.  You're tired, you want to book a car as soon as
              possible and leave for your final destination.. But you have to stand in line for paperwork,
               insurance, and get a key. Sometimes this process can take more than an hour waiting in line.
                 And when you finally get to the counter, an unpleasant surprise awaits you; the office 
                 accepts only physical credit/debit cards  but not ApplePay/GooglePay/CashApp, or the credit terminal
                  is faulty/dead.  The whole process is very inefficient and time consuming.</p>
                  &nbsp;
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
                  Or suppose another situation: Again the airport, but now you have a stop between flights 5-7 hours.
                  What will you be doing this time? Sit at the airport or take a taxi to see the city? My suggestion is to use cardsharing!
                  Exploring the city is much more convenient when you have a car. It is possible to see more than from a taxi, and cheaper.
                  And also you don't need to think about your luggage. You can take this with you.
                  </p>
                  &nbsp;
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
                      Hmmmm...it would be nice to have such a service not only at the airport!
                      For example, there is a parking in the city owned by a cardsharing service 
                      and you can use a free car at any time.  For shopping, for dating, for excursions.
                       For anything! But you don't need a car for the whole day, 
                       you want to rent it for 3 hours. Why not? Take this!

            <h3 className="font-weight-light">MY IDEA</h3> </p>
            <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            1.	Create your account on the website. Standard procedure :pass authorization documents, upload photo driver license, sign an agreement
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            2.	Install the app. Sign in
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            3.	Book a car and specify how long you plan to rent the car.
            The minimum rental period is 1 hour.  Additional time can be added in 30 multiple intervals.
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            4.	Calculation of the rental cost. The cost in dollars. 
                  Because holders of cryptocurrencies are more likely to answer
                   how many dollars they currently have in a crypto wallet, than how many ETH exactly they have. 
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            5.	Pay in cryptocurrency. There are not many businesses that accept cryptocurrencies for good and services at the moment.
             But the number of cryptocurrency users is growing and they have it in their wallets but there is nowhere to spend!
              NOT every cryptocurrency holder wants to spend their coins on luxury brands, or only on games, NFT.
               For more turnover and popularization , the Consumer needs ordinary , everyday expenses 
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            6.	Get NFT, this is your car key-activator. Since this NFT will be published on the OpenSea service,
             NFT should not disclose the details of the transaction, data, time, period, place. 
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            7.	Your NFT is also in the app, So that there is a connection with the activated car to open/close the car.
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            8.	Choose your car. Since there will be cars of the same type in the parking lot,
             you can take any of them. For example, closer to the exit, clean or parked evenly.
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            9.	NFT contains a QR code and in your personal account on the site a countdown timer to the end of the car rental
                  </p>
                  <p className="m-0 text-left text-white">
            10.	 In 7 days after the end of the car rental, the NFT burns down.
             You don't want to clutter up your wallet with unnecessary NFTs. You don't want to use the IPFS service unnecessarily
                  </p>
